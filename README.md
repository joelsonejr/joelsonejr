### Hi there 👋

<!--
**joelsonejr/joelsonejr** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm currently transitioning into the software development area, and it's being an amazing experience. 

Right now I'm more focused on Frontend development, but my end goal it to work with Fullstack development. 

🌱 I'm currently stuldying HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to improve my foundations, and get ready to go toward the nex level (🤔 Still deciding between Vue and React).

🔭 I’m currently working on some small projects. Most of them came straight from my lessons. But very soon I'll publish something of my own.

💬 You can ask me about everithing. I'll be glad to help.
