### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently transitioning to software development, and it's being an amazing experience. 

Right now I'm more focused on Frontend , but my end goal is to be able to work with Fullstack. 

ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to improve my foundations, and get ready to move toward the nex level (ðŸ¤” Still deciding between Vue and React).

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some small projects. Most of them came straight from the lessons I attend to, but very soon I'll publish something of my own.

ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about everything. I'll be glad to help.
